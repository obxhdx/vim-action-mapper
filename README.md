# vim-action-mapper

Act on text objects with functions and commands.

I'm not the original author of this code, I just wanted to make it easier to reuse.
The source is [this article](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Act_on_text_objects_with_custom_functions) from Vim wikia, albeit some modifications were made to allow mapping commands as well.
The whole idea was adapted from [vim-unimpaired](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired).

## Installation

Just use your preferred package manager ([vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), [neobundle.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim), etc).

## Usage

See [documentation](https://github.com/obxhdx/vim-action-mapper/blob/master/doc/action-mapper.txt).

## Related plugins

[TextTransform](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4005) does exactly the same thing. The only downside (for me) is that it requires [another lib](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4433).
